I really appreciate the thoughtful comments of all the reviewers. I've
worked hard to make the paper easier to understand, and proof read it
several more times. I include a point-by-point summary of the reviewer's
comments and my rebuttal below. Minor problems fixed without needing
further discussion are listed at the end.

Reviewer 1
==========

> p. 1 last full sentence: "The reorganization makes...because it
> conforms to a standard that facilitates well an initial exploration
> and analysis of the data; you don't..."

I'm not quite sure what the reviewer meant here, but I've rewritten the
entire paragraph for clarity.

> p. 2 line 2: Is "reformulating" an approximation for "munging"?

Yes, but I think mungling better conveys the inelegance of this
operation :)

> p. 3 bottom. Consider having a new bold subtitle as a guidepost for
> the reader: Defining tidy data:

I've completely reorganised this section and it should be much more
clear.

> p. 14 last paragraph. A difficulty is identified; does the author
> suggest a solution? Reader isn't clear where we are left as we enter
> the Case Study.

I'm not currently aware of any packages that resolve this problem, and
I've added a note to that effect.

> p. 21 down 13: might be clearer if "...an efficient equivalent to
> join." – bolding or perhaps quotes.

I've removed those comments because I know no longer think that they are
true.

I tried changing "data is" to "data are", and found the result grating.
I think you're right that the battle is lost.

Reviewer 2
==========

> While the topic is important and the message is clear, I found the
> tone of the paper to be too conversational. The author overuses
> contractions, ambiguous pronouns ("It's often said..."), and casually
> addresses the reader in second-person form. (R2)

I have largely kept the conversational style of the paper, while trying
to make it easier to understand. I don't think it's necessary for a
scientific paper to be too formal. This work appeals more to
practicioners of data analysis than academic statisticians, so I think
it is particularly important that the writing is approachable.

> The author also switches between the use of italics, boldface, quotes,
> and the LaTeX verbatim environment constantly, which tends to be
> distracting at times. (R2) - The author uses "colvars" in italics when
> first naming the terminology, and then subsequently mentions the Pew
> dataset contains one colvar, without italics. (R2) - The author does
> not use formatting on the column names in the caption for Table 9 but
> does use \verbatim to reference column names in Table 10's caption.
> (R2)

Thanks for pointing this out. Throughout the next I now use bold face
consistently for the first definition of a new term, and verbatim for
variable names.

> The author overuses colons. In some cases, I found hyphens to be more
> appropriate, and in others, I would think semicolons might be more
> suitable.

I've reviewed all colons and changed many to other forms of punctuation.

Reviewer 3
==========

> The author is obviously intimately familiar with the tools he's using
> in this paper, and he should remember that the readers of this paper
> are not nearly as familiar with them as he is. (R3)

I have tried to clarify terms and explain things more clearly
thoroughout the paper

> Section 2: "When using tables for communication, this so-called
> "Alabama first" (Wainer 2000) ordering should be abandoned, and
> replaced with an ordering based on a meaningful variable."

> There doesn't seem to be any justification or explanation for this
> statement. (R3)

Agreed, and I've removed it.

> Section 3.1: Since most readers of this paper will want to apply these
> ideas using R, I think it would be a good idea to show how an R
> datasets containing the Pew and Billboard data would look, as well as

I think including the code in the paper would make it too long, but they
are all available at the paper website at
https://github.com/hadley/tidy-data

> Section 3.5: I feel the examples in this section need to be explained
> in more detail. The referenced external links contain a large number
> of files, and it's not really clear which files are relevant to the
> discussion in this section. (R3)

I've added a brief snippet of R code to illustrate how you might tackle
this.

> Section 4.1: "Compare this to the difficulty of combining datasets
> stored in arrays; these typically require painstaking alignment before
> matrix operations can be used, and errors can be very hard to detect."
> Would anyone seriously suggest using matrices to store data which
> would be combined with other data sets? The use of an index to combine
> multiple datasets doesn't really seem to be related to tidy data. (R3)

Right, and I've now removed this sentence.

> Section 5: I was not able to download the data for the case study from
> https://raw.github.com/hadley/tidy-data/master/case-study/deaths.rdata;
> I recieved a 403 Forbidden error. (R3)

Smaller version that you can now download is at
https://raw.github.com/hadley/tidy-data/master/case-study/deaths.rds

> I think there should be a more thorough discussion explaining the goal

I've added a figure showing the temporal pattern over all causes of
death, and tweaked the explanation. Hopefully this should now be clear.

> p. 12, line 9: comma after file name?

> p. 12: This reviewer would prefer to avoid "hopefully" about 13 lines
